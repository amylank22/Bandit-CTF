The password is stored a in a file called data.txt where all lowercase 'a-z' and uppercase 'A-Z' letters have been rotated by 13 positions. Gather password for bandit12.  
```
#### ðŸ§© Explain the concept
```bash
The password file has rotated the characters, which is called substitution cipher used in the security. Linux uses the 'tr' command to translate the replaced characters. To use that we can use command "tr <old_character> <new_character>". 
Following are the example: 
alias rot13="tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'"
alias rot5="tr '0-9' '5-90-4'"
```
#### ðŸ’» Commands

``` bash 
In this level 11, using the tr command we ROT13 to substitute characters and decoded the text.  
```
---

## Level 12 â†’ Level 13
#### ðŸŽ¯ Goal 
```bash
The password is stored a in a file called data.txt where the hexdump is repeatedly compressed.  We are going to make /tmp directory to work using 'mktemp -d'. 
```
#### ðŸ§© Explain the concept
```bash
- We are going to create a tmp directory in the /tmp directory. This can be done using "mktemp -d". Copying the data.txt file to the /tmp/tmp.5daM5ZvBzm.
- After copying we reverse the hexdump "mv data.txt hexdump_data". This will convert the ASCII hex to binary data. 
- Based on the the file output, rename them to compressed_data.gz, then decompress it with "gzip -d compressed_data.gz". If the file is bzip2 we change the name to compressed_data.bz2 and decompressed it to "bzip2 -d compressed_data.bz2".
- This process is continued for the gzip, bzip2, and tar for multiple times. 
- We performed the repeated process of the decompressing the file until we reach the point of plain text. In the end, we used the cat command to view the file information for bandit13 password. 
```
#### ðŸ’» Commands
```bash
ssh bandit12@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
ls
mktemp -d
cd /tmp/tmp.5daM5ZvBzm

## Level 13 â†’ Level 14
#### ðŸŽ¯ Goal 
```bash
The password is stored a in a file /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. SSH into the next level instead of getting the password.   
```
#### ðŸ§© Explain the concept
```bash
This level teaches us to use the SSH private key to login to the next level instead of using the password directly. This can be done using the RSA key copying with scp command. To send the file to remote host we need to use the 'scp' command to transfer SSH data over the network. 
```
#### ðŸ’» Commands
```bash
ssh bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
ls
scp -P 2220 bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:sshkey.private .

Creating a bash script to run for the cron.d which runs at regular interval. 
```
#### ðŸ§© Explain the concept
```bash
The cron jobs are run at the regular interval, this task explains us to write a script to place a file that cron job will later copy or execute as the cron owner. Basically, we are manipulating the environment for the scheduled ob to perform the action to reveal the password for next level. 
```
#### ðŸ’» Commands
```bash
ssh bandit23@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
 mktemp -d
 cd /tmp/tmp.MvfMpR7kwR
nano bandit24_pass.sh - 
" #!/bin/bash
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/tmp.ljEyl6kv1M/password"
chmod +rx bandit24_pass.sh 
chmod 777 /tmp/tmp.ljEyl6kv1M
touch password
chmod +rwx password 
ls -la
cat password 
```

#### ðŸ“œ Output 
![password for bandit23](images/password24.1.png)
![](images/password24.2.png)
![](images/password24.3.png)

#### ðŸ“˜What have I learned?
``` bash 
In this level 23, I learned to create my own script for exploit cron jobs that copy files in a writable directory and get the results. 
```

## Level 24 â†’ Level 25
#### ðŸŽ¯ Goal 
```bash
A daemon is listening on 30002 and provides password for bandit25 with given secret 4 digit pin. 
```
#### ðŸ§© Explain the concept
```bash
Some of the program require us to enter the pins which might be a combination of lot of numbers. We can't go for guessing the number as it would consume a lot of time. Automation can be a simpler way to approach the program using the script. In this task, we will create the script to run the password and combination of the 4 digit pin. 
```
#### ðŸ’» Commands
```bash
ssh bandit24@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
nc localhost 30002
cd /tmp
mktemp -d
cd /tmp/tmp.
nano bruteforcepin.sh
" #!/bin/bash

for a in {0000..9999}
do
       echo gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8 $a >> possibilities.txt
done | nc localhost 30002 > keys.txt

cat keys.txt | grep bandit25" 
./bruteforcepin.sh
```
#### ðŸ”“Password for next level
```bash

#### ðŸ“œ Output 
![password for bandit23](images/password25.1.png)
![](images/password25.2.png)
![](images/password25.3.png)


#### ðŸ“˜What have I learned?
``` bash 
In this level 24, I learned about the program which interacts repeated by sending automated input using a loop or script to brute force a password. 
```

## Level 25 â†’ Level 26
#### ðŸŽ¯ Goal 
```bash
Bandit26 is not using the /bin/bash file. Logging to bandit25 to gather the password.  
```
#### ðŸ§© Explain the concept
```bash
It explains the use of the public-key SSH authentication. Instead of using the password to login we are using the private key file. SSH uses a keypair - private and public key. SSH just need to get proof for the private key and he can match the stored public key in the server. Vim text editor is used to edit the default shell for the user using ':shell' and :set shell=/bin/bash'. 
```
#### ðŸ’» Commands
```bash
ssh bandit25@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
cat /etc/passwd | grep bandit26
ls -la /usr/bin/showtext
ls 
chmod 700 bandit26.sshkey
ls
cat /etc/bandit\_pass/bandit26
```
#### ðŸ”“Password for next level
```bash

```
#### ðŸ“œ Output 
![password for bandit23](images/password26.1.png)
![](images/password26.2.png)

#### ðŸ“˜What have I learned?
``` bash 
In this level 25, I learned about connecting the different SSH key by switching the users with their private key file. 
```

## Level 26 â†’ Level 27
#### ðŸŽ¯ Goal 
```bash
Good job getting a shell! Now hurry and grab the password for bandit27!
```
#### ðŸ§© Explain the concept
```bash
Log into the bandit26 and it has file name bandit27-do. File is executable file as the binary runs with owner's permission the command executes the elevate rights. 
```
#### ðŸ’» Commands
```bash
ssh bandit26@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
ls
./bandit27-do
./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit\_pass/bandit27

```
#### ðŸ”“Password for next level

```
#### ðŸ“œ Output 
![password for bandit23](images/password27.png)

#### ðŸ“˜What have I learned?
``` bash 
In this level 26, I learned that we should not allow programs to run arbitary commands or setuid commands. 
```

## Level 27 â†’ Level 28
#### ðŸŽ¯ Goal 
```bash
SSH into the git - ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit27-git/repo via the port 2220. Password is in the bandit27-git. 
```
#### ðŸ§© Explain the concept
```bash
In this level, git is introduced via the ssh. Cloning a repo to your own directory using the ssh command. It also allows to make changes directly to git repo and commit it. 
```
#### ðŸ’» Commands
```bash
ssh bandit27@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
ls
mktemp -d
cd /tmp/tmp.
git clone ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit27-git/repo .
ls
cd repo
ls -la
cat README
```
#### ðŸ”“Password for next level

```
#### ðŸ“œ Output 
![password for bandit28](images/password28.png)

#### ðŸ“˜What have I learned?
``` bash 
In this level 27, I learned about using the ssh for the git cloning and reading the README file. 
```
---


## Level 28 â†’ Level 29
#### ðŸŽ¯ Goal 
```bash
SSH into the sh://bandit28-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo via the port 2220. 
```
#### ðŸ§© Explain the concept
```bash
In this level, we are going to do a git forensics. There might be few secret information stored into the tags and branches or on to the commits made in the past. We check for the raw git objects to reveal the content that is hidden on the branch.  
```
#### ðŸ’» Commands
```bash
ssh bandit28@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
mktemp -d
cd /tmp/tmp.cPFZNqgoxl
git clone ssh://bandit28-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo .
ls -la
cd repo
cat README.md
git status
git log
git checkout 68314e012
cat README.md
```
#### ðŸ”“Password for next level
```bash

```
#### ðŸ“œ Output 
![password for bandit29](images/password29.1.png)
![](images/password29.2.png)

#### ðŸ“˜What have I learned?
``` bash 
In this level 28, I learned git keeps that metadata than the visible information. This level help me understand to enumerate the refs, search of each and every commit and inspect the raw git objects. 
```
---


## Level 29 â†’ Level 30
#### ðŸŽ¯ Goal 
```bash
SSH into the git - ssh://bandit29-git@localhost/home/bandit29-git/repo via the port 2220.
```
#### ðŸ§© Explain the concept
```bash
Password in the file is missing as it shows no passwords in production. Git stores the content in the object but hidden in the old commits or tags. Here, we have used git plumbing and history tool to enumerate everything git knows. The main purpose is not only to look at branches but list all the refs, every commits, raw objects and packet data. 
```
#### ðŸ’» Commands
```bash
ssh bandit29@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
mktemp -d
cd /tmp/tmp.Qjbad6ocpi
git clone ssh://bandit29-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo .
ls -la
cd repo
cat README.md
git branch -a
git checkout dev
cat README.md
```
#### ðŸ”“Password for next level
```bash

```
#### ðŸ“œ Output 
![password for bandit30](images/password30.1.png)
![](images/password30.2.png)

#### ðŸ“˜What have I learned?
``` bash 
In this level 30, I learned that we should inspect each and every tags, refs, object in git for hidden information. 
```
---


## Level 30 â†’ Level 31
#### ðŸŽ¯ Goal 
```bash
SSH into the  ssh://bandit31-git@localhost/home/bandit31-git/repo via the port 2220. Grab the password for next level. 
```
#### ðŸ§© Explain the concept
```bash
In this task, the password is not visible or even in commit history. Tags in git are used as bookmarks - they point to commits and store the information. 'git tag' defines the tags and 'git show secret' will display the commit that particular tag has pointed. This explains to us that git tags are part of metadata of that repo. 
```
#### ðŸ’» Commands
```bash
ssh bandit30@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
mktemp -d
cd /tmp/tmp.cEArwTNdmd
git clone ssh://bandit29-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo .
ls -la
cd repo
cat README.md
git tag
git show secret

```
#### ðŸ”“Password for next level
```bash

```
#### ðŸ“œ Output 
![password for bandit23](images/password31.1.png)
![](images/password31.2.png)

#### ðŸ“˜What have I learned?
``` bash 
In this level 26, I learned that git holds much more important information and hidden data into its commits. Definitely, auditing the tags and commit can reveal sensitive information. 
```
